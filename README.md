ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is a Transportation and Metro Data Analysis web application that focuses on studying public transportation usage, especially metro systems, before and after the fuel price increase. The project analyzes trip distances, user behavior, and traffic volume changes.
The application provides visual insights and analytical dashboards based on real-world transportation datasets. The system is designed for data-driven decision-making and offers scalable insights for urban planning and transportation efficiency.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

Compare Usage Trends: Analyze changes in metro and transportation usage before and after the fuel price increase.
Distance Analysis: Study how trip distances vary across time periods and different transport modes.
Public Transport Insights: Provide detailed insights into metro usage patterns including peak hours, station popularity, and route preferences.

Policy Impact Assessment: Evaluate how fuel price changes impacted user decisions and transportation behavior.

Data Visualization: Offer clear and interactive visualizations for better understanding of complex data.
